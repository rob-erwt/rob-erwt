- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @rob-erwt
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a scrummaster with a background in webdevelopment (mostly PHP). 
- ğŸŒ± I'm mostly using my GitHub account for trying out new stuff. So you won't find much public stuff of me here (yet ğŸ˜‰)
- ğŸ“« If you want to reach me, send me an email or find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/robertbouma">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="https://mastodon.nl/@rob_erwt" rel="me">Mastodon</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/robertbouma">Twitter</a> and send me a message!
